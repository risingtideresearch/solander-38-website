# Scripts

Post-processing pipeline for 3D model exports and technical drawings.

## Setup
```bash
cd scripts
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pdf2image pypdf pillow  # for pdf_to_png.py
```

#### 1. `export-layers-glb.py`

Rhino Python script — run from within Rhino via `RunPythonScript`/`ScriptEditor`.

Iterates all layers and exports each as a GLB into a **versioned subfolder** named `{folder}-{unix-timestamp}/` (e.g. `models-1749200000/`). The manifest is written to the selected folder at the fixed path `models/export_manifest.json`, keeping that path stable while GLB URLs change each run — this drives cache busting on Netlify (`Cache-Control: immutable`).

When prompted, select the manifest folder:
- Main hull → `frontend/public/models/`
- Deck jig → `frontend/public/models-jig/`

The versioned GLB folder is created as a sibling automatically. `export_info.models_folder` in the manifest records which versioned folder was used.

~8-12 minutes to complete for the full model set.

---

#### 1b. `optimize-glb.sh`

Compresses all GLBs using [gltfpack](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer). Reads `models_folder` from both manifests to find the current versioned GLB directories, processes main and jig files together, and updates `file_size` entries in both manifests after completion. Downloads `gltfpack` automatically on first run. Typically, this reduces file size ~90%.

Run immediately after `export-layers-glb.py`, before `main.py`.

```bash
./optimize-glb.sh               # optimize all GLBs (main + jig)
./optimize-glb.sh --dry-run     # preview which files would be processed
./optimize-glb.sh --simplify=0.85  # triangle retention ratio (default 0.92)
```

The front end uses `useGLTF(..., undefined, true)` to decompress meshopt files automatically via `meshoptimizer`.

#### 2. `main.py`

Orchestrator — runs material extraction, PDF conversion, manifest copying, and Sanity audit.

```bash
python main.py                  # full pipeline (skips unchanged PDFs)
python main.py --skip-pdf       # skip PDF conversion entirely
python main.py --full-pdf       # force reconvert all PDFs (clear output first)
python main.py --skip-audit     # skip Sanity reference audit
```

Steps:
1. Reads `models_folder` from `models/export_manifest.json` and extracts material info from the versioned GLB folder → `frontend/public/script-output/material_index_simple.json`
2. Copies model manifest to `studio/script_output/`
3. Converts new/changed PDFs in `frontend/public/drawings/` to PNGs; skips unchanged ones
4. Copies drawing and material manifests to `studio/script_output/`
5. Runs `audit-sanity-refs.py` to check Sanity references (skippable with `--skip-audit`)

Requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` in `frontend/.env` for the audit step.

---

#### 2a. `pdf_to_png.py`

Called by `main.py`. Converts drawing PDFs in `frontend/public/drawings/` to PNGs under `frontend/public/drawings/output_images/`. Maintains a `conversion_manifest.json` with UUIDs, filenames, and metadata used by the Sanity drawings dropdowns.

Skips PDFs whose output PNG is already newer than the source file — only new or modified PDFs are converted. Use `--full-pdf` in `main.py` to force a clean rebuild (e.g. after changing DPI). UUIDs are derived from image content so they remain stable across incremental runs.

---

#### 2b. `extract_materials.py`

Called by `main.py`. Reads GLB files and builds a material index (which materials appear in which models). Output is used by the anatomy page hover display and Materials table in Stories (dynamically displayed from related models).

---

#### 2c. `audit-sanity-refs.py`

Queries Sanity and cross-references against local manifests to find stale links. Also runs automatically at the end of `main.py`.

Checks:
- **`relatedModels`** on articles — GLB filenames against both `models/` and `models-jig/` manifests
- **Drawing references** in image sets — UUIDs against the drawings conversion manifest

Prints stale references with fuzzy suggestions for renamed files.

```bash
python audit-sanity-refs.py
```
